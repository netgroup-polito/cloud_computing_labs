# Docker

The goal of this laboratory is to introduce **Docker** technology, which underpins most modern **cloud-native services** and provides an easier way to use lightweight virtualization primitives — namely **cgroups** and **namespaces** — while also introducing several additional features such as a **layered file system**, **application repositories**, and more.

Docker builds upon the foundational components introduced in the Linux kernel and represents the most successful implementation of the **lightweight virtualization** concept.
It enables the creation of lightweight, portable, and self-contained **containers**, which package applications together with all their dependencies.
Under the hood, Docker leverages the Linux kernel’s primitives to create **isolated virtual environments** where applications can run independently and consistently.

This lab will provide a hands-on introduction to Docker’s main functionalities and demonstrate how to build and manage containerized environments efficiently.

**EXTRA**: In addition to this text, a set of videos is available covering some of the topics discussed in this laboratory.
