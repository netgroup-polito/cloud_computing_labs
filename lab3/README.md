# Lab 3 - Introduction to Kubernetes
This lab aims at practicing with a Kubernetes cluster and getting in touch with its capabilities.

The first part of the lab deals with the creation and setup of the cluster, which consists of three VMs: one playing the role of *control plane* node, and two of *worker* nodes. The VMs will be hosted on [CrownLabs]( https://crownlabs.polito.it/).

Upon cluster installation, the second part of the lab allows you to practice with the basic Kubernetes concepts, such as *pods*, *deployments* and *services*, to understand how to execute simple applications. Afterward, you will create more complex configurations, accounting for high-availability concerns.

> **Extra**: In addition to this text, we provide several videos which discuss some parts of the topics of this lab. You can find them on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTAfidx4guQImT5beuAs4YAhIzuBBoEHk)
