# Lab 4 - Publish your own website with Kubernetes on CrownLabs

The goal of this laboratory is to practice with the complete workflow required to **create, package and deploy a website on a Kubernetes-based cluster**.
Overall, this aims to better highlight how the different building blocks learned during the previous laboratories (e.g.,containers creation, applications deployment and exposition, …), can be combined to achieve a fully functional service.

The very same approach, then, could be generalized, to account for more complex scenarios composed of multiple microservices which cooperate together and implement complex functionalities. An example of such complex setup is provided by the [Online Boutique demo application](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) made available by Google.

> [!NOTE]
> This laboratory takes inspiration from a real-world use case, and requires the student to apply the concepts learned during the previous laboratories in a more autonomous way.
> Therefore, the laboratory will provide tasks descriptions and high-level guidelines, while leaving the details of the implementation to the student.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In case you get stuck, you can refer to the [Appendix](./appendix/README.md), which provides example solutions for each task.
> However, it is *strongly* suggested to first try to implement the different sections on your own, before looking at the proposed solutions.
